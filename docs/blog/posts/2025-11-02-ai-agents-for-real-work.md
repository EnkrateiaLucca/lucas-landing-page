# Notes on Using AI Agents for Work

These are my notes on this article from Ethan Mollick: ["Real AI Agents and Real Work"](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/real-ai-agents-and-real-work)

- OpenAI Created a [new test for AI ability](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/d5eb7428-c4e9-4a33-bd86-86dd4bcf12ce/GDPval.pdf) where they asked experts with +14 years of experience to design [tasks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gdpval/viewer/default/train?views%5B%5D=train) that would take a human expert 4 to 7 hours to complete
  - [Human experts won (barely), however surprinsingly, the reason for most AI failures was formatting and instruction following issues rather than hallucinations and errors.](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/real-ai-agents-and-real-work#:~:text=Human%20experts%20won,replace%20human%20jobs%3F)
  - [AI can't replace a job if it can't replace the complexity involved with human interactions as a whole](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/real-ai-agents-and-real-work#:~:text=%20ai%20doing%20one%20or%20more%20of%20these%20tasks%20does%20not%20replace%20my%20entire%20job%2C%20it%20shifts%20what%20i%20do.%20and%20as%20long%20as%20ai%20is%20jagged%20in%20its%20abilities%2C%20and%20cannot%20substitute%20for%20all%20the%20complex%20work%20of%20human%20interaction%2C%20it%20cannot%20easily%20replace%20jobs%20as%20a%20whole...)
- [Really interesting use of Claude 4.5 Sonnet to replicate results of papers given the relevant data](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/real-ai-agents-and-real-work#:~:text=I%20gave%20the,much%20as%20possible%3F%E2%80%9D)
- [small improvements in a model’s accuracy on single steps can add up to huge gains when tasks require many steps in sequence.](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/real-ai-agents-and-real-work#:~:text=even%20small%20increases%20in%20accuracy%20(and%20new%20models%20are%20much%20less%20prone%20to%20errors)%20leads%20to%20huge%20increases%20in%20the%20number%20of%20tasks%20an%20ai%20can%20do)
- Interesting benchmark I didn't know about [METR](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) measures AI's ability to complete long tasks
- [I like this point Ethan makes about the importance of reflecting on why we do work and what it should look like to avoid drowning in a sea of AI generated content](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/real-ai-agents-and-real-work#:~:text=if%20we%20don%E2%80%99t%20think%20hard%20about%20why%20we%20are%20doing%20work%2C%20and%20what%20work%20should%20look%20like%2C%20we%20are%20all%20going%20to%20drown%20in%20a%20wave%20of%20ai%20content.)
- Simple workflow suggested by OpenAI is:
    - Delegate to AI as a first pass
    - review
    - if not good enough, try a few attempts at correcting & instructing
    - If still not good enough, do the work yourself
- Estimation is that this simple strategy could yield a 40% increase in speed and make work 60% cheaper (although not sure how they measured the later)
- Having appropriate judgement about how we use AI and what we choose to use it for can lead to it making us more cabaple reather than just more productive
