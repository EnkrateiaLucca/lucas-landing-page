These are my GPT-5 summary notes on the amazing lecture by Chris Lonsdale about how to learn any language in 6 months:

Key premise
- Any adult can reach functional fluency in about six months by applying five principles and seven actions that are within the learner’s control.

Five core principles
- Relevance drives memory: Focus on content that matters to your life/goals (attention → meaning → relevance → memory).
- Use the language as a tool from day one: Communicate to create real value; don’t wait to “finish” studying before speaking.
- Comprehensible input first: Understand the message and the language will be acquired unconsciously (well-documented by research).
- Train your body, not just your mind: Hearing new sounds and speaking clearly are physiological skills (ear training + facial/mouth muscles).
- Optimize your state: Learn best when relaxed, curious, and tolerant of ambiguity; avoid perfectionism and anxiety.

Seven key actions
- Listen a lot (“brain soaking”): Flood your brain with the language’s rhythms, patterns, and standout sounds—even before full understanding.
- Get meaning before words: Use context, body language, visuals, and known patterns to grasp messages; let words attach to meaning.
- Start mixing early: With even 10 verbs, 10 nouns, and 10 adjectives, create hundreds of meaningful combinations; be creative, not perfect.
- Focus on the core:
  - High-frequency vocabulary (1000 words ≈ 85% of daily talk; 3000 ≈ 98%).
  - Week 1 toolbox phrases: “How do you say…?”, “Please repeat,” “What does that mean?”, “I don’t understand,” in the target language.
  - Weeks 3–4 glue words: although, but, because, therefore, so—enable complex meaning.
- Get a language parent (not a spouse):
  - Their four rules: work hard to understand you; never correct; paraphrase to confirm meaning; use words you know.
- Copy the face: Observe and imitate native mouth/face movements; build a feel-sound feedback loop for clear pronunciation.
- Direct connect: Link new sounds directly to mental images/experiences (same concept box, different sound path), not via translation in your mother tongue.
