# Sup Folks!

I'm an AI Engineer, and [AI instructor at O'Reilly Media](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/getting-started-with-langgraph/0642572005882/), I like writing about building cool tools. 
A few years ago, after spending some time as a research assistant at the [Champalimaud Foundation](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/) I pivoted to industry and started working as an AI engineer, and now I help people develop AI models, tools, and all sorts of fun stuff.

From time to time I also do some [neat workshops](https://odsc.com/blog/speaker/lucas-soares/) about stuff I find interesting in AI.
