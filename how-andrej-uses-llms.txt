# Actionable Tips for Using LLMs from Andrej Karpathy

## Understanding LLM Basics

- **Start new chats when switching topics** to maintain context efficiency
  > "Anytime you are switching topic I encourage you to always start a new chat... I encourage you to do this because these tokens in this window are expensive"

- **Be aware of which model you're using** and choose the appropriate tier for your needs
  > "I always encourage you to keep in mind what model you are actually using... make those tradeoffs for yourself depending on your usage of llms"

- **Consider using multiple LLMs as a "council"** for important questions
  > "often I end up personally just paying for a lot of them and then asking all all of them the same question and I kind of refer to all these models as my llm Council"

## When to Use Thinking Models

- **Try thinking models for difficult math and coding problems**
  > "there exist a class of models that we call thinking models... these models are most effective for difficult problems in math and code... they can push up the accuracy of your performance"

- **Use regular models for simple queries and thinking models only when needed**
  > "I usually try out the non-thinking models because their responses are really fast but when I suspect the response is not as good as it could have been... I will change it to a thinking model"

## Tool Use Strategies

- **Use internet search for recent information or knowledge outside the model's training data**
  > "whenever I expect that the answer can be achieved by doing basically something like Google search and visiting a few of the top links... I expect to use the search tool"

- **Try deep research for comprehensive understanding of complex topics**
  > "is a combination of internet search and thinking and rolled out for a long time so the model will go off and it will spend tens of minutes doing deep research"

- **Upload documents to provide context for specific questions**
  > "when I'm reading books it is rarely ever the case anymore that I read books just by myself I always involve an LM to help me read a book"

- **Use Python interpreter capabilities for data analysis and visualization**
  > "one practical setting where this can be quite powerful is what's called Chach Advanced Data analysis... it basically gets chpt to be kind of like a junior data analyst"

## Multimodal Interaction Tips

- **Use voice input instead of typing to save time**
  > "don't type stuff out use voice it works quite well and I use this pervasively and I would say roughly half of my queries probably a bit more are just audio because I'm lazy and it's just so much faster"

- **Upload images for analysis (e.g., nutrition labels, medical results)**
  > "First transcribe this into text and the reason I like to First transcribe the relevant information into text is because I want to make sure that the model is seeing the values correctly"

- **Generate images to summarize information or create visual content**
  > "the way I use this functionality is usually for arbitrary content creation"

- **Use video capabilities on mobile for real-time analysis**
  > "you basically have the camera running you can point it at stuff and you can just talk to the model it is quite magical super simple to use"

## Personalization Techniques

- **Use memory features to help the model understand your preferences**
  > "over time it really gets to like know you to some extent and it will start to make references to the stuff that's in the memory"

- **Create custom instructions to modify how the model interacts with you**
  > "you can to a very large extent modify your chash GPT and how you like it to speak to you"

- **Build custom GPTs for repetitive specialized tasks**
  > "what this feature really is is that it's just saving you prompting time if there's a certain prompt that you keep reusing"

## Specific Use Cases

- **Use LLMs for language learning with custom translators**
  > "I have a Korean detailed translator and when I put that same sentence here I get what I think is much much better translation"

- **Code with assisted tools like Cursor for programming**
  > "majority of my time personally and professionally is spent writing code but I don't actually go to chpt and ask for Snippets of code because that's way too slow"

- **Generate podcasts on niche topics using tools like NotebookLM**
  > "it will generate a custom podcast on whatever sources of information you put in here"

- **Provide examples when creating instructions (few-shot prompting)**
  > "when I give instructions to llms I always like to number one give it sort of the description but then also give it examples"
