All right, so next topic for the article is about the generation and composition of primitives. Douglas Engelbart discusses this as like external symbol manipulation, right? So you have primitives and then you manipulate those primitives to learn something. And now this is a tricky subject because I think that what constitutes a primitive is also like open a little bit for debate. For example, if we think about drawing, you have primitives like, I guess, drawing lines, shading, I guess, not a perspective, but like, for example, when you draw a cube like symmetry, I have to think about, for example, in math, what is a primitive? I guess primitives have levels, right, like, for example, variables, that's a primitive.
[0:01:00]

[0:01:00]
In programming, maybe it's a little bit easier. Variables, data types, for loops, conditionals, all of those are primitives and the definition of a primitive is like this simple element object that you can compose with others to form more complex structure, like in language it's pretty easy, right? You have syntax words and meaning, you have words and different groups of words that you can put together to form complex sentences. So that's one thing. What I was thinking in this topic of primitives is that AI was providing us with like new primitives or the ability to compose new primitives, and the thing I had in mind was like how structured outputs were this interesting thing, right? Because structured outputs allowed us to like, for example, feed an unstructured raw text
[0:02:00]

[0:02:00]
into church PT and then get a diagram out of that text. So for me, the primitive there is like the ability of converting that raw text into diagram. So the primitive is like, you can now diagramize or, I don't know, yeah, you have this ability now to like, meanfully convert raw unstructured text into this visually appealing and visually organized representation. So there are two things I want to discuss in this topic, but I don't think I have reached a good consensus yet, which is exactly what constitutes a primitive in the topic of learning. And I obviously, I am touching on the right idea. Primitive is like some small element that can be composed to form complex meanings and whatever.
[0:03:00]

[0:03:00]
And then AI's contribution is like offering these new cognitive technologies to compose new types of primitives. For example, creating a diagram out of raw text, that's a new primitive that AI allows, right? And then with image generation with high fidelity, the other primitives are being created. But I still need to reflect exactly, I need to like refine a little bit what I mean.

[0:00:00]
All right so another huge insight by chatting up with CHADPT. So I described this problem of like trying to hone in on what I meant about primitives and generating composing them and as I said in the beginning it gave some very interesting renditions but I was missing a little bit about that thing of like AI's contribution being more in a different level that I thought was at the primitive level but we actually got the fact that it's not at the primitive level. What I'm what I was trying to get at is what CHADPT called it epistemic operations because the AI's contribution that I was describing was like semantic zooming or converting round notes into diagrams these were not new domain primitives they were epistemic operations. Operations that act on representations to change how a learner can access traverse and orient themselves within knowledge and a useful working definition CHADPT gives us an epidemic operation is a reversible transformation on a
[0:01:00]

[0:01:00]
representation that changes the learner's access to meaning without changing the underlying content this is fucking awesome and then why these are not primitives because primitives are inside the skill there are actions the learner must internalize and then perform themselves which I mean okay sure I'm not sure that that's true I'm a bit confused still because I'm considering many skills like learning language the learner must internalize I mean okay let's let's assume that that's true but then what epistemic operations do is around the they go around the scope they reshape the learning surface not a target behavior and that makes perfect sense with the semantic zooming example and the others right and then he goes in to say okay so zooming in and out of text via summaries the primitive the AI is introducing is not a summary it's a new capability which is the continuous zoom over semantic density and now the
[0:02:00]

[0:02:00]
learner can with this new capability move between overview and detail reorient without losing global structure control granularity dynamically right so this is an epistemic navigation primitive not a domain primitive because it lowers entry costs without collapsing the learning task so this is a perfect way to put it it's a epistemic navigation primitive not a domain primitive that's fucking awesome and then the example of generating diagrams from unstructured text right the value that's given by AI is not diagram but it's the modal translation of meaning going from text to spatial structure in this case right when you generate a mermaid diagram especially when you generate a diagram that you can then put in an excali draw and manipulate the little aspects and details of the thing that you generated that makes relations explicit and visually like checkable externalizes structure and reduces working memory reduces working memory load so the learner still has to understand
[0:03:00]

[0:03:00]
relationships AI just changes the medium where the learners understanding those relationships and for the diagram example that's like super easy to see why and did I give another example was like you describe some chords and then AI would generate like a piano sheet right why that's super interesting because what AI is enabling here is representation lifting which is going from low level symbolic description into high level executable notation now nothing about core theories learn for the learner but the learner is now oriented faster able to act sooner and then grounded in a concrete artifact so the unifying idea is that and this is the best quote AI is introducing a new layer of controllable transformations over representations not over scales it's a new layer of controllable transformations over representations that's perfectly put I
[0:04:00]

[0:04:00]
wish I wrote that and these transformations don't automate the skill they don't remove learning steps they reduce orientation cost and they expand navigability of complex material material which fits perfectly into my article because I can position this between primitives and self-directedness like I can talk about primitives which means the things that we have to internalize and we define it as like the the small atomic things that are units that can be composed and then epistemic operations which is how learners enter traverse and structure the space and then Chesapeake suggests like the third framing which is agency and authorship which means what learners do once they're oriented in that space so the role of AI is not of a tutor not of a solver but of a controllable transformer of representations that's beautiful maybe I wouldn't use the word transformer controllable shifter controllable change
[0:05:00]

[0:05:00]
now controllable transformer is fine for now so the one-line takeaway would be like AI's most pedagogical interesting contribution is not automating thinking but giving learners new ways to move through meaning and that's pretty dope

[0:00:00]
So, again, focusing a conversation with Judge Petit only on primitives, we got something very interesting. So, I gave the article and I asked it about, like, how could we define primitives specifically and how AI could come in as a contributor for generating these primitives, composing them, manipulating them, and helping people potentially generate new ones. So, definition that Judge Petit gave that I like is a primitive as a smallest meaningful manipulable unit of action in the domain. This topic of action in domain comes from the previous section as well about the direct manipulation of the behaviors that matter, and I feel like primitives are just the units of that behavior, right? The units, not the of the behavior, the behavior is the thing that you're observing, right? They are the units that allow you to manipulate behavior.
[0:01:00]

[0:01:00]
They're like the gears. So, for example, in music it would be like the finger placement, a scale, a rhythmic pattern. Regarding that, yeah, I'm not, I need a better definition than saying that because, obviously, they're probably different, a different hierarchy of primitives, right? Because, like, finger placement is about stuff in your body, right? For example, rhythmic pattern is not in your body, is in the music theory, or is in the world, is in nature, so maybe there's, there needs a distinction there. And programming would be, it's a big user, functions, loops, data structures, math would be like operations, transformations, proof steps, and drawing would be like strokes, perspective constraints, shading rules, I guess I was right when I was talking about drawing primitives, like the lines and the, whatever, and, but, the four elements of a good primitive would
[0:02:00]

[0:02:00]
be like being atomic enough to practice directly, being semantically loaded, which means that it does something real in the domain, being composable, and then observable, and it's effects. So with all of that, I just want to say that why they matter in learning environments, because effective learning environments make primitives explicit, now this is a bit tricky, because what does it mean to make a primitive explicit, like, for example, I mean, like pencils, and paper are probably like the one of the best learning environments for drawing, right? But the contributions are just like the, the, the, the core tools for you to act on the medium domain are there, but that's it, like there's not the arts, like is the pencil in the paper
[0:03:00]

[0:03:00]
making the primitives explicit, no, you have to go in and draw. So, so I have to think about, when discussing this thing about learning environment, maybe I need a definition that accounts for the fact that they're, they're like different, these different levels, you can go very niche, which means like making an interactive artifact with cloud desktop for learning about sampling distributions, and a little bit more broad, like pencil and paper. But effective learning environments also allow learners to manipulate these primitives directly. They support composition into higher order structures. I talked about that in the previous recording regarding the idea of like language and regarding the idea of composing more complex things out of simple things, provide immediate feedback on primitive level actions, right? That's true. Like, for example, if you're coding and you're in the, uh, rapid environment, the, the rebel environment in a programming environment, you give feedback on everything that you create,
[0:04:00]

[0:04:00]
the variables, the functions, et cetera. So that's pretty cool. Like, I jumped their notebook is like the best example of that, right? And a shifting learning from recognition to control, master is not knowing what the pieces are. It's knowing what happens when you move them. That's my favorite quote, mastery is not knowing what the pieces are. It's knowing what happens when you move them, right? You have to be able to predict behavior. That's probably one of the foundational marks of mastery, right? You know what happens when this and that happen. How AI can contribute to primitives without replacing learning. Yeah. Most valuable below the level of final answers, raw execution operating primitive layer. It can help surface hidden primitives and expert workflows decomposed tasks into learnable atomic actions, generate domain appropriate starter primitives for beginners. So okay, these are kind of like, like the suggestions from charge PT here are a little bit like, uh, the meta of the meta.
[0:05:00]

[0:05:00]
I think the only one that I'm more interested in would be like generate domain appropriate starter primitives. I don't know about the starter primitives, but generating domain appropriate primitives. It's a little bit what I was going for with the example I had in mind was so silly, like converting raw notes into diagrams, but like there's got to be more stuff in it, right? And then instead of writing for program, AI can propose defining the input transforming data, validating the output, each becomes a concrete practice unit. Yeah, but this is not what I meant by primitive. So, and this is more like AI helping to like guide and yeah, it's not exactly that running what if variations on a primitive, modify parameters while holding others constant, exposing edge cases and constraints. This is all like a to the rich aspect of AI. So, I did not grasp what I meant about primitives, I think.
[0:06:00]

[0:06:00]
And then I said primitive composition, suggesting valid compositions, detecting compatible or redundant combinations, offering alternative compositions. It doesn't replace composition, it expands the learner search space. Okay, but this is this quote that just provided is key. Never automate the primitive, the learner is trying to internalize this fucking awesome thing. Yep. I'm going to put this on my personal notes, this is really, it's a really cool note. Never automate the primitive, the learner is trying to internalize. Automate around the primitive, scaffold towards it, fade assistance as control improves. This preserves the reps required for skill acquisition while lowering unnecessary friction. Transition point for your article.
[0:07:00]

[0:07:00]
From here, the natural next section is constrain self-directedness, turning learners into alters from primitive control to system design, it can generate manipulating compose, autonomy becomes possible. Yeah, but I don't think Judge PT kind of grasped what I meant by primitives, but now I think I'm getting to something interesting, I'll talk about that in the next recording.

I'm going to do a little bit of research to define very strictly what I mean by primitives and stuff like that but I wanted to make one point about the topic of primitives and composing primitives which is that I do feel like everything is like every skill you're learning every subject is like is a language everything is language something that you have to like start with the little nodes with the little primitives and then grow over time to like be able to speak more complex more interesting sentences so that was the point everything is kind of a language I feel and if you treat everything as a language you give names to things and then you put these names together I think you can develop skill and stuff like that if you like develop part of the process of developing skill is about acquiring vocabulary and acquiring like expressive capability like acquiring the ability to express yourself in like
[0:01:00]

[0:01:00]
complex sentences and stuff like that

[0:00:00]
I did a quick chat with Chech Petit and Chech Petit made a very interesting point that I was actually really pointing at control over causal levers of the domain, which I guess makes sense. It's not just about exposure to representations of the domain, it's about controlling the relevant behaviors that matter, it's about controlling and acting on the same primitives that produce outcomes in the real domain and then observing the consequences of those actions with minimal interaction. So it's about causal alignment, I mean, it's about you have to act on the things that actually matter for you to learn how that system behaves, how that language works, et cetera, and then gives a few examples like in physics, instead of just writing equations on paper, you work
[0:01:00]

[0:01:00]
in a simulation where the learner applies forces, changes mass, adjusts friction, et cetera. Because then the learner is going to control forces constraints in initial conditions and the equations become descriptions of behavior, not the behavior, right, that's nice. The equation is just there to describe a rich behavior, which supports isolation of variables, experimentation, and then seeing behavior, not just symbols, and then statistics, and this is a perfect example of something that AI can really help with. You can, in a re-environment, you would be reading about confidence intervals and p-values, right, like in a traditional stats class. In a stronger environment, you would interactively re-sample data sets, change sample size, and that watch estimates change, right. So the learner controls data generating processes, not just outcomes. Statistical concepts emerge from manipulation, not just explanation.
[0:02:00]

[0:02:00]
So that would tie to automation of external symbol manipulation, immediate feedback, direct manipulation of primitives. Like with Claude, at JetPT, Gemini, today, you can create these little interactive environments for different classes, different classes of statistics, like different statistics, statistical concepts, which I think is interesting. For language learning, you should produce meaning, not just recognize answers, this like, you should not like do a lingo only, right, multiple choice for collaborative quizzes, because that's just recognition of correction, or correct, there should be in an environment where you have constrained conversations, where you're producing utterances, which you've ghost, like negotiating, asking, repairing, misunderstanding, like the tutor, which at JetPT, that simulates situations like restaurants and airports, then you have to like get around those situations, right? That kind of makes perfect sense.
[0:03:00]

[0:03:00]
Because then you control which words to choose, the syntax to use, the actual pragmatic intent of the thing, which reinforces authorship, goal-oriented interaction, modification of behavior to feedback, and then in electronics, you should wire circuits in not just label diagrams. So in a weak environment, you'd be identifying components and schematics. In a strong environment, you would be wiring actual components, either virtually or physically. You would be changing resistance voltages, observing the flow and failure modes, et cetera. Music composition, this is a very interesting one, versus music theory. Like you could read about core progressions in harmony rules, all you want, right? But in a strong environment, you would be like a system where the learner constructs progressions, changes voicing tempo instrumentation, and here's the result instantly, which, like when I was playing around with that thing of the circle of fifths and experimenting,
[0:04:00]

[0:04:00]
I really saw that. I really saw that anytime something comes in, I have to like play it and hear it and understand it like through some physical action in the piano. Because it doesn't go away by you reading the logic of the way. You have to like live it, you have to like experience it. And be interesting to see like what would be like a true musical environment of the future where just acting and moving around that environment allows you to learn faster, better, et cetera. That could be really cool. So the learner controls time, harmony structure, not just labels, right? Theory becomes a compression of experience. And it gives an example for machine learning, urban planning, where people would be simulating like zoning, transit, dancing, pretty interesting.
[0:05:00]

[0:05:00]
We're drawing, drawing, so you could watch a drawing tutorial or you should draw. I mean, tools, the lead drawing, learn the form, mirror layer, and it just constrains like perspective grids or proportions. I feel like for drawing would be more about like how we could simulate like like smaller scenarios and situations to help learners hone in specific skills. This could be very interesting to do with like nano-banana or something, like, I mean, AI can now like simulate exercises, I used it to like create drawings, et cetera. But yeah, it could be cool to see what else could one do with that. I don't know. And then touch, it goes, I useful litmus tests, you can include in the article.
[0:06:00]

[0:06:00]
You can phrase it like if a learner can succeed without ever performing the action that causally generate outcomes in the domain, the environment is teaching about the subject, not enabling learning of the subject. Ah, this is very nicely put. The more steps between learner action and domain behavior, the weaker, the learning environment, meaning, ah, this is awesome, that's true. The more steps between learner action and domain behavior, the weaker, the learning environment, meaning designing a learning environment is all about reducing the steps between learner action and domain behavior. So immediate feedback only matters if the feedback reflects your actions. That's true, authorship only exists if you can do things that matter and things that matter mean controlling the behaviors that affect the relevant outcomes of the subject. Constraint interactivity not only works if constraints are placed on real primitives.
[0:07:00]

[0:07:00]
Constraint interactivity only works if constraints are placed on real primitives, that's true. Automation is useful only when it removes irrelevant actions, not relevance. That's so awesome, that is so true, I have to take a special note of that. This framing also aligns closely with ideas popularized by people like Andy Matuschak around agency, feedback loops, direct manipulation, but ah, yeah, super cool. Automation is only useful when it removes irrelevant actions, not relevant ones. I'm going to make a post about that.

[0:00:00]
On the topic of direct control, of relevant behaviors to the subject of hand, for that article about requirements for effective learning environments. So here's what I would say. If you're playing music, you have to play the keys in the piano, control the behaviors, and then see what happens, right? And then correct. Have some sort of promises where you're correcting yourself all the time. Great. Same thing with programming. A lot of people try to create these simulated coding environments where everything is made easy for students, which could work up to some point regarding like learning syntax, but as far as learning how to program, they have to be in direct control of the relevant behaviors for the environment instead of like controlling proxies of behaviors. I think that's a good point. Besides that, there's probably more regarding this topic
[0:01:00]

[0:01:00]
that I'm not really sure that I'm covering here.

[0:00:00]
This is for my article about requirements for learning environments. This is the section about complexity, like organizing in difficulty levels, complexity levels to match the learner's experience and stuff. I mean, it is pretty much what it says, right? The idea here is that it's useful. I mean, first the paper that talks about the fact that people learn more optimally if they're like getting a right 85% of the time. So I feel like this is a fingerprint for how difficulty should be thought of. It should be thought of complexity for learner appropriateness, should consider that given the learner's experience,
[0:01:00]

[0:01:00]
like the difficulty of the environment is a function of the learner's experience, plus whatever parameters that need to be constrained or addressed or whatever, so that the learner is getting it right 85% of the time. Like, as an anecdote, I was practicing piano the morning and I was feeling like motivated and stuff, also because I'm medicated so I got like my good brain moment was playing the piano. But what I felt is that if I was doing just random stuff, I was getting no reward. But if I was doing something very hard, I was getting very demotivated. But when I started to engage my brain to try to do something, and I was actively trying to solve problems and I was getting it wrong quite a bit, but I was getting it wrong while getting it right, if it makes sense. I don't know if it was 85%, but it was some ratio of, I see some progress here, that's like measurable,
[0:02:00]

[0:02:00]
and measurable, like by me, subjectively, and yeah, and that felt engaging and motivating. It could be a little bit of placebo or just, it could be something associated just with the fact that I was medicated, so my brain was like in a good place to learn something, but I think there's something to that, to that because I was, yeah, I was engaged.
