The discovery began with researchers investigating how bacteria defend themselves against viral attacks.\n\nBacteria, despite being single-celled organisms, have sophisticated defense mechanisms. When a virus (bacteriophage) attacks a bacterium, the bacterial cell can capture small pieces of the viral DNA and store them in special regions of its own genome called CRISPR arrays (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats). These stored DNA sequences serve as a molecular memory bank.\n\nThe breakthrough came when scientists realized that bacteria use this stored information along with proteins called Cas (CRISPR-associated) to recognize and cut up viral DNA during future attacks. The Cas9 protein acts like molecular scissors, guided by RNA sequences derived from the stored viral DNA fragments.\n\nJennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier made the crucial leap in 2012, demonstrating that this bacterial system could be reprogrammed to target any DNA sequence. By designing custom guide RNAs, researchers could direct Cas9 to cut specific locations in any organism's genome with unprecedented precision.\n\nThis discovery transformed genetic engineering from a slow, imprecise process into a fast, accurate, and relatively inexpensive technique. CRISPR-Cas9 has since been used to develop new treatments for genetic diseases, create disease-resistant crops, and advance our understanding of gene function across countless species.\n\nThe impact extends far beyond the laboratory. Clinical trials are underway for CRISPR treatments for sickle cell disease, certain types of blindness, and various cancers. The technology has also raised important ethical questions about the extent to which we should modify human genes, particularly in embryos where changes would be passed to future generations.\n\nToday, CRISPR continues to evolve, with new versions offering even greater precision and new capabilities, promising to reshape medicine, agriculture, and our understanding of life itself."
